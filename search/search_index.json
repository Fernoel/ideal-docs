It was built by the same team behind Puppeteer. Unlike Selenium, which uses the WebDriver API (HTTP), Playwright uses a direct WebSocket connection to communicate with browsers, allowing it to be significantly faster and more stable.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2026/02/04/frequently-asked-questions-playwright-automation-vs-selenium/#playwright-vs-selenium-what-are-the-main-differences","title":"Playwright vs Selenium: What are the main differences?","text":"Feature Selenium Playwright Architecture WebDriver-based (HTTP). Translates commands to JSON. Direct WebSocket protocol (no HTTP overhead). Speed Generally slower due to WebDriver overhead. Very fast with lower latency. Waits Requires manual explicit/implicit waits to avoid flakiness. Native Auto-wait: automatically waits for elements to be ready. Language Support Java, Python, C#, JS, Ruby, PHP, etc. JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET (C#). Browsers All major browsers + IE. Chromium (Chrome/Edge), Firefox, WebKit (Safari)."},{"location":"blog/2026/02/04/frequently-asked-questions-playwright-automation-vs-selenium/#why-is-playwright-faster","title":"Why is Playwright faster?","text":"<p>Playwright communicates with the browser through a single WebSocket connection that remains open throughout the test. This eliminates the need to establish multiple HTTP connections for each command (as Selenium does), drastically reducing latency and execution times.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2026/02/04/frequently-asked-questions-playwright-automation-vs-selenium/#what-is-auto-wait-and-why-is-it-important","title":"What is \"Auto-wait\" and why is it important?","text":"<p>One of Playwright's biggest advantages is its auto-wait capability. Before performing an action (like clicking or typing), Playwright automatically checks if the element is visible, enabled, and actionable. This removes the need to write repetitive \"explicit wait\" code (<code>WebDriverWait</code>) common in Selenium, making scripts cleaner and less prone to random failures.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2026/02/04/frequently-asked-questions-playwright-automation-vs-selenium/#is-it-hard-to-learn-playwright-if-i-know-selenium","title":"Is it hard to learn Playwright if I know Selenium?","text":"<p>Not necessarily. If you already know automation concepts and languages like JavaScript/TypeScript or Python, the transition is smooth. Playwright offers tools like Codegen (code generator) that records your actions in the browser and automatically generates the test code, which is great for learning the syntax quickly.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2026/02/04/frequently-asked-questions-playwright-automation-vs-selenium/#should-i-migrate-to-playwright-in-2026","title":"Should I migrate to Playwright in 2026?","text":"<p>If you are starting a new project, Playwright is generally the recommended choice due to its speed, stability, and modern features (like native support for React/Vue components and API testing).
