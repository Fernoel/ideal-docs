# Schedules

Control when your circulars go live.

## Key Concepts
- **Go Live Date**: The exact timestamp when the circular becomes accessible to the public.
- **Expiration Date**: When the circular is archived.
- **Timezone**: Schedules are relative to the store's configured timezone.

## Usage
Use the calendar view to drag and drop publication windows.
